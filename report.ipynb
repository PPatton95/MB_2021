    "This report describes a solution to the **University of Bristol - Machine Learning Paradigms Kaggle competition**, which requires prediction of bicycle availability at rental stations across Valencia. The competition consists of three phases:\n",

    "* **Phase 1**: Given a month of historical data from 75 [201:275] stations, predict 3 months of bicycle availability for each station, by \n",
    "    * (a) generating a learning model for each individual station, trained on it's own data\n",
    "    * (b) generating a combined learning model which trains on all station data. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Phase 2**: Predict bicycle availability by applying linear models trained on 200 other stations [1:200], where multiple models for each station have been provided. Determining the best blend of these models to produce optimim results is determined experimentally. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Phase 3**: Attempt improved prediction performance by combining both the learning model from **Phase 1** and the linear models from **Phase 2**. <br><br>\n",

    "The first step in the process of generating predicitive models is to properly understand the dataset. The dataset provided consists of various features, including information regarding the individual **station** and the **time** and **weather**, and task-related features to do with the time-history of number of bikes at each station.\n",
